# 🧠 AI Coding Interviewer

A web platform that simulates **real-life coding interviews** with an AI interviewer.  
Users can solve coding challenges in a realistic coding environment, chat with an AI interviewer for hints/feedback, run code against test cases, and track progress over time.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **AI Interview Mode**  
  👨‍💻 Chat with an AI interviewer who adapts to your answers, asks follow-ups, and gives feedback.

- **In-Browser Code Editor**  
  ✍️ Powered by Monaco (same editor as VSCode).  
  Supports Python and JavaScript with syntax highlighting, autocomplete, and more.

- **Custom Test Cases**  
  🧪 Add and manage test cases just like in LeetCode/HackerRank.  
  See pass/fail results in real-time.

- **Interactive Chat Panel**  
  💬 Persistent conversation with AI. Includes code, problem context, and test results in its reasoning.

- **Local Persistence**  
  💾 Everything (code, test cases, chat) autosaves in `localStorage`. Refresh without losing progress.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS
- **Editor**: Monaco Editor (`@monaco-editor/react`)
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express  
  - Runs Python/JavaScript code in a sandboxed process
  - Connects to OpenAI API for AI interviewer responses
- **Database**: *(planned, not yet implemented)* PostgreSQL for persistence
- **Auth**: *(planned, not yet implemented)* GitHub login
