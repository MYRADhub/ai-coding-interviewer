# 📋 Project TODO

Track ongoing work on the AI Coding Interviewer. Update this list as tasks progress.

## High Priority

- [x] **Interview Agent Persona**
  - Script conversation phases (intro, clarification, guidance, wrap-up) and persist stage state.
  - Prompt now nudges the AI to ask guiding questions, reference validation state, and produce structured wrap-up feedback once tests pass.

- [ ] **Session Management**
  - Add “Start New Interview” flow with problem selection.
  - Support clearing code/tests/chat or duplicating a previous session.
  - Surface past attempts/history (timestamp, problem, validation status).

- [ ] **Hidden/Official Test Suites**
  - After local tests pass, run server-side suites and present verdicts or failing scenarios.
  - Distinguish user-defined vs. official test statuses in UI.

## Nice to Have

- [ ] **Interview Modes & Scoring**
  - Timed rounds, strict vs. supportive interviewer personas.
  - Final scorecards and rubric-based evaluations.

- [ ] **Collaboration & Export**
  - Shareable links or downloadable transcripts/code for mentorship or portfolio use.

- [ ] **Personalization**
  - User preferences: default language, preferred theme, interviewer style, targeted skill focus.
