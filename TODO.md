# 📋 Project TODO

Track ongoing work on the AI Coding Interviewer. Update this list as tasks progress.

## High Priority

- [x] **Interview Agent Persona**
  - Script conversation phases (intro, clarification, guidance, wrap-up) and persist stage state.
  - Prompt now nudges the AI to ask guiding questions, reference validation state, and produce structured wrap-up feedback once tests pass.

- [x] **Session Management**
  - Added in-app “New Interview” button that resets the workspace while archiving the previous attempt.
  - Session history now records timestamps, language, and verdict and is displayed on the home dashboard.

- [x] **Hidden/Official Test Suites**
  - Backend now runs predefined official cases per problem and reports them alongside user tests.
  - Frontend validation summary shows both custom and official counts so users know what’s left.

## Nice to Have

- [ ] **Interview Modes & Scoring**
  - Timed rounds, strict vs. supportive interviewer personas.
  - Final scorecards and rubric-based evaluations.

- [ ] **Collaboration & Export**
  - Shareable links or downloadable transcripts/code for mentorship or portfolio use.

- [ ] **Personalization**
  - User preferences: default language, preferred theme, interviewer style, targeted skill focus.

Update this file when a task is completed or new work is identified.
